    <h2>Observations</h2>
    <p>An individual comes up to the Whole Foods self-check with a bag full of vegetables.  She clicks the start 
        button and begins to scan the items with the bar code. She then places peppers on the scale, clicks the 
        select button, and looks at all the vegetable types. She hesitates for a second before clicking one of the
         pepper pictures, and she then puts the pepper in her bag. She continues this with the rest of her fruit.
          She then clicks the payment method, selects a credit card, and pays. </p>

    <body>
        <ul style="list-style: none;">
            <li>When do you use the self-checkout station?</li>
            <l1 style="color:#6F9BB8;"> I use the self-checkout station almost every time I am here. I think it
                 is easier to deal with than waiting in line and interacting with the store clerks. </l1>
            <li>What are the benefits of using self-checkout stations?</li>
            <li style="color:#6F9BB8;">I think the benefit of using self-checkout stations is you do not have to 
                interact with any of the store clerks, and it really is something you can just do on your own. </li>
            <li>Is there anything that confuses you when you use the self-checkout stations?</li>
            <li style="color:#6F9BB8;">I think the thing that confuses me the most when I use self-checkout 
                is when I have to scan the fruits and vegetables. Sometimes it is confusing because you are not sure 
                which type of fruit or vegetable is the one in the picture, and it gets confusing when you have multiple 
                of the same fruit.</li>
            <li>Is there anything you wish you could change when using the self-checkout stations? </li>
            <li style="color:#6F9BB8;">I think self-checkout is a great idea and it is pretty easy to understand.
                 I definitely think that weighing the fruit and vegetables is something that could be done to make 
                 it easier. </li>
            <li>How long does it take to use the self-checkout station?</li>
            <li style="color:#6F9BB8;">It usually takes me 5 to 10 minutes to use self-checkout.</li>
            <li>How would the self-checkout station be challenging for a first-time user to use?</li>
            <li style="color:#6F9BB8;">As I said before, vegetable/ fruit weighing seems to be the most 
                challenging thing for first-time users. I also think it sometimes is just an overwhelming 
                experience the first time you do it. </li>

    <h1><u>Person 2</u></h1>
    <h2>Observations</h2>
    <p> An individual comes to the self-checkout with a basket full of food. He is struggling to 
        scan one of his items. He tries to scan the same item several times, but the machine does not recognize it.
         He goes up to the customer service person and asks for help because his item is not scanning. The customer 
         service person takes his keycard and scans the barcode and manually types in the item for the customer. 
         The customer scans the rest of his items and then pays. </p>
    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <body>
        <ul style="list-style: none;">
            <li>When do you use the self-checkout station?</li>
            <li style="color:#6F9BB8;">I usually use the self-checkout station when I only 
                have a couple items I have to check out, otherwise, I wait in the in-person line.</li>
            <li>What are the benefits of using self-checkout stations?</li>
            <li style="color:#6F9BB8;">I think the benefit of self-checkout is that it is faster than waiting 
                in the in-person line, especially when you do not have a lot of items. Also, the people checking 
                you out are not judging the food you are getting. </li>
            <li>Is there anything that confuses you when you use the self-checkout stations?</li>
            <li style="color:#6F9BB8;">Every once and a while there is something that does not scan right, and I have to go 
                talk to someone to help. </li>
            <li>Is there anything you wish you could change when using the self-checkout stations? </li>
            <li style="color:#6F9BB8;"> I think just making sure that everything works and scans, especially 
                for people like me who are rushing to get to work and need to get a couple of things. </li>
            <li>How long does it take to use the self-checkout station?</li>
            <li style="color:#6F9BB8;">It usually takes about five minutes. </li>
            <li>How would the self-checkout station be challenging for a first-time user to use?</li>
            <li style="color:#6F9BB8;">The machines pretty much walk you through what you have to do,
                 so I think someone trying it for the first time could figure it out.  </li>

    <h1><u>Person 3</u></h1>
    <h2>Observations</h2>
    <p> An individual walks in and places her bins on the side of the self-check. She scans all of her items 
        and weighs the fruits and vegetables. She places her items in her bag and takes out her wallet and puts 
        her card into the machine. </p>
    <h2>Questions</h2>
    <body>
        <ul style="list-style: none;">
            <li>When do you use the self-checkout station?</li>
            <li style="color:#6F9BB8;">I use the self-checkout station every single time I go to Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>What are the benefits of using self-checkout stations?</li>
            <li style="color:#6F9BB8;">I really think that it is super easy to use. You do not need to interact 
                with anyone. You do not have people anxiously waiting for the store clerk to scan all of your items. 
                It is a much more relaxing, go-at-your-own-pace vibe. </li>
            <li>Is there anything that confuses you when you use the self-checkout stations?</li>
            <li style="color:#6F9BB8;">I really have never had any issues with the self-checkout station before, 
                so there is nothing really I am super confused about. Plus, if someone ever is confused about 
                something the workers can help you figure it out. </li>
            <li>Is there anything you wish you could change when using the self-checkout stations? </li>
            <li style="color:#6F9BB8;"> I wish that you would know the price of fruits and vegetables as you put them on the machine
                 and if the cost was by item number or the weight of the item.</li>
            <li>How long does it take to use the self-checkout station?</li>
            <li style="color:#6F9BB8;">It usually takes me ten or so minutes to finish self-checkout.</li>
            <li>How would the self-checkout station be challenging for a first-time user to use?</li>
            <li style="color:#6F9BB8;">I think that it would not be challenging at all. It is super easy to figure 
                out how to scan everything. Maybe, weighing the fruits and vegetables might be a little confusing for 
                new users. </li>
